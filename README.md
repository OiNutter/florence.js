Florence.js
=============

Florence.js is a framework agnostic plugin for creating sexy interactive image carousel. It uses CSS3 animation (with a fallback to Javascript) to create animated filtering, reordering and rotation of your carousel.

Usage
-----

Include the florence.js file in your page

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/path/to/florence.js"></script>
```

Set up your carousel like this (I know the class on each element is a bit ugly, but it keeps you safe if you have any sub divs. If you know that isn't the case feel free to omit it and change the selector option when initialising)

```html
<div id="guggenheim-container">
	<div class="guggenheim-slider">
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>1</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>2</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>3</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>4</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>5</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>6</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>7</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>8</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>9</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>10</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>11</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>12</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>13</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>14</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>15</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>16</div>
		<div class='guggenheim-item'>17</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

Now initialise your gallery

```Javascript
var gallery = florence(element[,options]);
```

Where element is either the css selector of the container, or the actual DOM element itself. Options is an optional argument that will specify customisation variables. The full range of options is detailed below.

* selector - `div.guggenheim-item` - The CSS selector for the gallery items.
* rows - `auto` - How many rows the gallery should have, if `auto` it will calculate how many will fit into the container (container must have fixed height).
* cols - `auto` - How many columns the gallery should have, if `auto` it will calculate how many will fit into the container (container must have fixed width).
* duration - `0.5` - How long each animation should last.
* easing - `ease` - Exasing type for animations, currently supports `ease` and `linear`.
* slider - `div.guggenheim-slider` - CSS selector for the internal wrapper element used for the gallery pagination.
* width - `null` - Integer width for the container in pixels. If null will expect there to be a width set in the css.
* height - `null` - Integer height for the container in pixels. If null will expect there to be a height set in the css.

Once you have your gallery initialised you can manipulate it by calling one of the methods detailed below on it.

Methods
-------

### Filter ###

``` Javascript
gallery.filter(class|classes|filterFunction);
```

The `filter` function will filter the items in your gallery based on one of the 3 possible argument types.

* class - If you pass a string through, guggenheim will search for elements that have a class with the same name. You can pass a list of optional classes by seperating them with the `|` character e.g. `'red|blue'`.
* classes - You can also pass an array of class strings through, using the format specified by the class option. Guggenheim will filter to elements that match all supplied class strings.
* filterFunction - Alternatively you can just pass your own function to run on each element.

`filter` will return an array of the matching elements


### Order ###

``` Javascript
gallery.order(newOrder);
```

The `order` function will reorder the elements according to the order passed through to it. `newOrder` should be an array of css selectors that will uniquely identify each element, such as ids, or an array of DOM elements.

`order` will return an array of the re-ordered elements


### Reset ###

``` Javascript
gallery.reset();
```

The `reset` function resets the gallery to it's initial, unfiltered, unordered state.

### Pagination ###

``` Javascript
gallery.next();
gallery.prev();
gallery.jumpTo(page);
```

The `next`, `prev` and `jumpTo` buttons are used for paginating through the gallery. There are also `currentPage` and `numPages` functions to help integrate with your chosen pagination script.


CSS
---

The minimum CSS required for this to work is to specify a width and height for the gallery container. You can either set these in CSS or pass them as options to Guggenheim. Guggenheim will add the rest of the required styles.

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/OiNutter/guggenheim.js.png)](http://travis-ci.org/OiNutter/guggenheim.js)

To build guggenheim you will need to install Jake and uglify-js.

``` bash
npm install -g jake
npm instal uglify-js
```

Then just run

``` bash
jake guggenheim:build
```

This will minify the file and place it in the dist folder.
